Double Queue/SSTF:

Total number of cylinders swept(Device 0) = 5507
Total number of cylinders swept(Device 1) = 145
Total number of cylinders swept(Device 2) = 36
Average number of cylinders swept per disk access(Device 0) = 3
Average number of cylinders swept per disk access(Device 1) = 2
Average number of cylinders swept per disk access(Device 2) = 2
Service time per I/O request(Device 0): 864
Service time per I/O request(Device 1): 243
Service time per I/O request(Device 2): 854
Average Service time per I/O request: 654
Throughput: 1/654

FIFO:

Total number of cylinders swept(Device 0) = 11993
Total number of cylinders swept(Device 1) = 97
Total number of cylinders swept(Device 2) = 17
Average number of cylinders swept per disk access(Device 0) = 7
Average number of cylinders swept per disk access(Device 1) = 2
Average number of cylinders swept per disk access(Device 2) = 1
Service time per I/O request(Device 0): 988
Service time per I/O request(Device 1): 489
Service time per I/O request(Device 2): 851
Average Service time per I/O request: 776
Throughput: 1/776

Given the above statistics, we can see the double queue/STTF method is much more efficient since it has to swap across lesser tracks compared to FIFO and hence takes lesser time to service a I/O request. Moreover, the throughput of the system increases comparably when double queue/SSTF is used.
